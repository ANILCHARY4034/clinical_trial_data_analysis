 Clinical Trial Data Analysis with CDISC SDTM Mapping

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end clinical trial data analysis workflow** using a publicly available **Bell’s Palsy clinical trial dataset**.
The objective of this project is to showcase skills in **clinical data cleaning, analysis, patient-level listings, and CDISC SDTM mapping**, following industry-style practices.

Objectives

* Clean and standardize raw clinical trial data
* Create patient-level listings for clinical review
* Generate summary analysis using pivot tables and charts
* Map cleaned data to **CDISC SDTM domains (DM, AE, QS)**
* Maintain proper documentation and data traceability
* Present the complete workflow in a structured GitHub portfolio

 Data Cleaning

 Standardized categorical values (e.g., Yes / No)
 Ensured one row per patient where applicable
 Checked for missing and inconsistent values
 Maintained a **Data Cleaning Log** to document all changes

Analysis Performed
Recovery by Treatment Group
Age vs Recovery Outcomes
Adverse Events Summary

Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel pivot tables and results were visualized using charts.

Patient-Level Listings
Created subject-wise listings
One row per patient
Sorted by patient identifier
Used for clinical data review and validation

CDISC SDTM Mapping

The cleaned data was mapped to basic CDISC SDTM domains
**DM** – Demographics
**AE** – Adverse Events
**QS** – Questionnaire / Outcome Scores

This demonstrates an understanding of **regulatory data standards** at an entry-level.

Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* SQL
* SAS
* CDISC SDTM concepts

Screenshots

The `Screenshots` folder contains visual proof of:

* Data cleaning steps
* Pivot table analysis
* Charts
* Patient-level listings
* Folder structure

(Note: Excel files may need to be downloaded to view, as GitHub does not render `.xlsx` files in the browser.)

Conclusion

This project highlights practical skills required for **entry-level Clinical Data Analyst / Clinical Data roles**, including data cleaning, analysis, documentation, and CDISC SDTM mapping.
It reflects a structured and industry-aligned approach to handling clinical trial data.
